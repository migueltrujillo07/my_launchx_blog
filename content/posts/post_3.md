There two interesthing options in GitHub Fork and PullRequest, this two options help to us to colaborate in a common project.
When we use the the fork function we are copy a someone's repository to our GitHub profile now we can work on it and  make any change without chage the original repositoty.
Now, Waht happen if we find a misteke or maybe we would just change something? There is the opction of Pull Requests with this option we can ask to the respotory's authot that we want to make some modifications, if the author of that respository accept our changes we can see immediately.
Both option are really helpfull if we are working in a project with a team, you can modify the code and then requests a chance if it is neccesary
